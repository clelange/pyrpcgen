What is it ?
============

This package contains a Python module that allows to connect to call
procedures on remote servers using the Sun RPC protocol. It also
contains a code generator, that allows to generate client stubs for an
RPC protocol.

Documentation
=============

M.I.A.: have a look at the example.sh script

Dependencies
============

You need to install Ply, « Yet Another implementation
of lex and yacc for Python », available from

#example using virtualenv
virtualenv /tmp/env
. /tmp/env/bin/activate
pip install ply

Download
========
The current/latest development version is
available from the GIT repository available at
https://github.com/hawk78/pyrpcgen.git .

Difference with rpcgen
======================

rpcgen automatically runs the C preprocessor (cc -E) before parsing
the file, which allows to use #define, #include, #ifdef and other C
preprocessor directives in XDR files.

pyrpcgen doesn't run the C preprocessor, so you must do it manually if
you want to use preprocessor directives.

Authors
=======

This code has been primarly written by Fred Isaman
<iisaman@citi.umich.edu>. The code generator is based on work done by
Peter Astrand <peter@cendio.se> and has been extended by Thomas
Petazzoni <thomas.petazzoni@enix.org> to generate client stubs.

This version has been extended by Vincenzo Di Massa <hawk.it@tiscali.it>
<vincenzo.dimassa@thalesgroup.com> in order to add more types to the ones 
supported by rpcgen and support to both TCP a UDP sockets.
